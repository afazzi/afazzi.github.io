We are up and running!

This is our first post with the new Hugo setup. We've implemented several improvements:

{{< alert type="success" >}}
âœ… Modern Hugo configuration

âœ… Better content organization
{{< /alert >}}

## What's Next?

We can continue to enhance this site with:

- Custom CSS animations

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example using our new shortcode:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our Hugo site!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```
